        <p>My favorite hobby is reading leisurely and informative books full of interest in free time. Whenever I go home from school, after completing my homework, I like to read books like this. Now, I know it well, that reading books is a very good habit. This hobby can be developed by anyone, however, I have found it naturally. Reading books keeps me happy and busy. It is a good source of pleasure, knowledge, encouragement and information. No person can remain alone and disturbed by reading books. I believe that this habit is more valuable than gold in the world. It gives me a high level of knowledge, ideal ideas, good thinking, etc. to work in various fields. I am fond of reading books, good and full of interest is like a good friend.</p>
